Basic concepts of Singleton:
1-Single Instance: Only one instance of the class is created throughout the programâ€™s lifecycle.

2-Global Access Point: The instance is globally accessible,
meaning you can access the same instance from anywhere in the program.

3-Private Constructor: The constructctor is private, so no other code can create an instance of the class directly.

4-Static Method for Access: A static method (ofthen called getInstance) provides the single instance of the class. 
when this method is called for the first time, it creates the instance; on subsequent calls, it returns the existing instance
