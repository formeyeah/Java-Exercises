 Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design.
   three main groups of patterns:
   Creational patterns: creates object creation mechanisms -> flexibility, reuse of existing code
   Structural patterns: how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the structures efficient
   Behavioral patterns: effictive communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects
